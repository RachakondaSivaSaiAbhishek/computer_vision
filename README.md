# Basic Image, Video, and Webcam Processing in OpenCV (cv2)

This repository provides a collection of simple scripts and code snippets for performing basic image, video, and webcam processing using OpenCV (cv2) library in Python. OpenCV is a popular computer vision library that provides a wide range of tools and functions for image and video processing.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Load and display images, perform basic operations such as resizing, cropping, rotating, and applying filters.
- **Video Processing**: Read and display videos, extract frames, and process each frame individually.
- **Webcam Processing**: Capture video from a webcam, apply real-time filters and effects, and display the output.

## Installation

To use the scripts and code provided in this repository, you need to have OpenCV (cv2) installed on your system. You can install it using `pip`:

```shell
pip install opencv-python
```

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Usage

Each script in this repository focuses on a specific task and comes with detailed comments explaining the code. You can run the scripts directly by executing the Python files:

```shell
python script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you want to run.

## Contents

1. `image_processing.py`: Demonstrates basic image processing operations.
2. `video_processing.py`: Shows how to read and process videos.
3. `webcam_processing.py`: Illustrates how to capture and process video from a webcam.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your requirements. The scripts serve as a starting point for beginners to get familiar with OpenCV and its capabilities for image and video processing.
